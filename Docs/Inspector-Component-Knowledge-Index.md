# Inspector Component Knowledge Index

## Canonical Source

Use this as the primary source of truth for authored fields:

- `/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/Inspector-Verified-Field-Matrix.md`

## Deep Dives

Use these for component-specific behavior that is too detailed for the matrix:

- `/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/Animation-Library-Authoring-Notes.md`
- `/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/Audio-Component-Library-Relationship.md`

## Historical Log

Use this for chronology and decisions made during implementation:

- `/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/Inspector-Components-Research-Log.md`

## Fixture Roots

- `/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/references/ComponentExploration`
- `/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/references/ComponentFieldExploration`

## Consolidation Policy

1. Add new field-level discoveries to:
`/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/Inspector-Verified-Field-Matrix.md`
2. Add complex component semantics to a dedicated deep-dive note in:
`/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/`
3. Keep implementation history and rationale in:
`/Volumes/Plutonian/_Developer/Deconstructed/source/Deconstructed/Docs/Inspector-Components-Research-Log.md`
4. When conflicts exist, trust fixture diffs over earlier notes.
