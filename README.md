# Deconstructed
![App Icon image replicating the official one but in direct complementary colors](./assets/AppIcon.png)

A macOS document-based application that reverse-engineers [Reality Composer Pro](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/reality-composer/) functionality including support for editing `.realitycomposerpro` native files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Open development status:** Deconstructed is developed in the open, and this repository contains the active source code.
> The public build path depends on the public `USDInterop` package family (`USDInterfaces`, `USDInterop`, `USDInteropCxx`, `USDOperations`) and does not require any private or binary-only USD package.
> Download the latest packaged macOS app from [Latest Release](https://github.com/elkraneo/Deconstructed/releases/latest), or build from source using the workspace and setup notes below.

![Deconstructed app interface with multiple scene tabs open. A Bunsen burner model is selected in the scene hierarchy and displayed in the 3D viewport alongside a gray sphere with transform gizmos visible. The right inspector panel shows Transform properties (Position, Rotation, Scale), Material Bindings, Variants, and References sections. The bottom Project Browser displays asset thumbnails including the BunsenBurner.usdz file, scenes, and primitive shapes.](./assets/preview.png)

## Purpose

[Reality Composer Pro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitycomposerpro) (RCP) is Apple's professional tool for creating 3D content and spatial experiences for visionOS and iOS. While powerful, its file format and package structure aren't officially documented. **Deconstructed** aims to:

1. **Open** `.realitycomposerpro` package files
2. **Parse** and display the project structure
3. **Edit** scenes (USDA) and assets through a similar native macOS interface
4. **Save** changes back to the package format

## Technical Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Platform | macOS 26 (Tahoe) only |
| UI Framework | SwiftUI |
| Architecture | The Composable Architecture (TCA) 1.23.1 |
| Document Model | SwiftUI `DocumentGroup` + `FileDocument` (`FileWrapper`-backed `RCPPackage`) |
| File Watching | FSEvents (macOS native API) |
| 3D Viewport | `RealityKitStageView` (StageView) + USD (Swift/C++ interop) |
| Swift Version | 6.2 with strict concurrency |

### External Dependencies

- **[swift-composable-architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)** - App architecture and reducer composition
- **[USDInterop](https://github.com/Reality2713/USDInterop)** - Public OpenUSD package family (`USDInterfaces`, `USDInterop`, `USDInteropCxx`, `USDOperations`)
- **[StageView](https://github.com/reality2713/StageView)** - RealityKit-backed viewport component

## Build From Source

Use:

- Xcode 26.3 or newer
- `Deconstructed.xcworkspace`

Notes:

- the committed manifests use remote package URLs for CI and fresh clones
- local first-party package overrides are optional and should be configured in the workspace, not by editing committed manifests
- package macros may require local approval in Xcode the first time you build on a machine

## Document Format

The `.realitycomposerpro` document is a bundle (package) with this structure:

```
Package.realitycomposerpro/          # The document bundle
├── ProjectData/
│   └── main.json                    # UUID mappings for scenes
├── WorkspaceData/
│   ├── Settings.rcprojectdata       # Editor settings
│   ├── SceneMetadataList.json       # Hierarchy state
│   └── <user>.rcuserdata            # Per-user preferences
├── Library/                         # Asset library
└── PluginData/                      # Plugin-specific data

Sources/                             # Assets (sibling to document)
└── <ProjectName>/
    ├── <ProjectName>.swift          # Bundle accessor
    └── <ProjectName>.rkassets/      # Asset directory
        └── Scene.usda               # USD scene files
```

The `.realitycomposerpro` bundle is the **document itself**, while the parent folder containing `Sources/` is the SPM package wrapper for Xcode integration. RCP treats `main.json` as a loose index - the filesystem is the source of truth for what exists.
